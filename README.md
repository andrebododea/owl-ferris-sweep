# Owl Ferris Sweep

This is a fork of the [Ferris Sweep project](https://github.com/davidphilipbarr/Sweep), which is itself a fork of [Ferris by Pierre Chevalier](https://github.com/pierrechevalier83/ferris) that uses a daughter board like a promicro, elite-c, bit-c, etc. instead of using onboard components.

The main difference I've made here is that I've pulled the Sweep 2.1 version of the board, I've deleted the old silkscreen artwork, and I've added in some owl artwork.|

The QMK keymap and configuration is heavily based on [Ben Vallack's 34 key Ferris Sweep layout](https://github.com/benvallack/34-QMK-Ferris-Sweep), with some light modifications. 

As you can probably tell by now, my motivation to build this was heavily inspired by Ben Vallack and his video on the [Ferris Sweep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqpBKuEVinw) build he made, as well as his videos on various keyboard layouts for 40% keyboards. Build instructions for this keyboard can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBPu7AyDtkM_) and are what I plan to follow when all parts and PCB's arrive.

Future plans for this involve:
- Actually building it once all the parts arrive. I've used Kailh V1 Choc Silver switches, and MBK Choc keycaps in white, as well as two Elite-C controllers, and some extra components (TRRS jack, TRRS cable, usb C cable)
- 3D print a custom tented mount for the board using the 4-screw puck mount included on the PCB that was originally intended for splitkb's [mounting puck](https://splitkb.com/products/tenting-puck?_pos=1&_psq=tenting%20&_ss=e&_v=1.0)
- Include assembly instuctions for the mount and flashing instructions for the Elite C microcontrollers
- Include some photos
